Mud Client Protocol
===================

This implements the basics of the MCP2.1 protocol for out-of-band
communication between a MUCK/MOO/MUD server and the clients that can
support it.  This doesn't implement the actual MCP packages that use
this protocol, other than the standard mcp-negotiate, and mcp-cord
packages.
